          <p>Hi I am Divyanshu Kontey. I have designed this website to make people aware of what farmers suffer from and what 
            kind of struggels they go throught. With this website I want to initiate the cause <b>"For The Farmers"</b>.
          </p>

          <p>As we know Farmer are not only suffering but also their voice remains unheard most of the times because the main media
            foucuses on entertainment nowadays. So I believe if we ourselves do not do anything no one is going to come forth for 
            helping the farmers.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this website I want to create a platform where people can not only see what is really happening with the farmers but
            also <b>BrainStorm</b> for the solutions which we can provide for the government to gelp the farmers. I also want to promote 
            if some organisations or individuals come up with solutions which they can implement without the help of the Government.
          </p>
